After executing the above commands, you have access to this project. 

- The main logic can be found in the main.js file.
- The main styles are in the style.css file (for larger projects I would use sass but in this case I decided it wouldn't be necessary).
- For better readability, the contents of the `document.querySelector('#app').innerHTML` variable can be dropped directly into `div id="app"` in index.html.

Enjoy your exploration :)
